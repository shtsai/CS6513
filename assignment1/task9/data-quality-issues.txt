1. The data contains a lot of noises and it is not clean.
   There are many misplaced things like quotation marks and commas in the data files.

2. The data field values are not uniform. For example, in the color field, for the same color white,
   there are many different values, such as "WH", "WHT", "WHITE", etc. This makes grouping data difficult.

3. There are many empty values.
